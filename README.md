# IMPORTANT: Before you run!

- Make sure the extracted folder does not nest the project folder. Otherwise the code editor will not know the file directory
- Run "npm install react-scripts --save" in the console before running "npm start" to install all necessary dependencies.

# Introduction

This is a project where I had to implement a product detail page matching the provided desktop design. I tried to keep all the components as simple as possible while also looking at re-useability.

# Technologies used

## Framework

Even though I am actually much more used to working with plain JavaScript and I only have 3 weeks of experience with React.js I still decided to take on this project using the React.js framework. Since I know that React is very much in demand and learning it will surely put me ahead in my field.

I admit that I did face some tuff challenges getting to know this framework while also working on a project that could change my life, but if I were to do it again I would still have made the same choice as it helped me grow and get familiar with this powerful framework even faster.

## Styling

For styling I used plain CSS. Plain CSS is still a very powerful design tool and it was all I needed to create the look of this app in a pixel perfect way.

## Added Features

- A Countdown Timer flashes to give the user a subtle reminder that their deal is limited.
- Button Hover effects to make the page more responsive.

## Platform

I used Node.js as the platform for my project since it is needed for many great technologies and services.

## Version Control

I used Github for my version control since it is very popular and used in almost all workspaces.

## Code editor

I use Virtual Studio for all my coding projects since it just works very well with any OS and is very customizable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
